# 🛳️ Titanic Survival Prediction

This is my first end-to-end Machine Learning project using the famous Titanic dataset from Kaggle.  
The goal is to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster using various features like age, class, gender, etc.

## 📊 Project Overview

- ✅ Dataset: Titanic (from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic))
- ✅ Model Used: **Logistic Regression**
- ✅ Accuracy Achieved: **81%**
- ✅ Tools & Libraries:
  - Python
  - Pandas, NumPy
  - Seaborn, Matplotlib
  - Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, train/test split, metrics)

---

## 🔍 Steps Followed

1. **Data Exploration & Cleaning**
   - Checked for missing values
   - Imputed missing Age values
   - Dropped or filled other missing features

2. **Visualization**
   - Used `countplot()` from Seaborn to analyze survival distribution
   - Explored features like `Sex`, `Pclass`, `Embarked`, etc.

3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Converted categorical features to numerical
   - Selected the most relevant columns for the model

4. **Model Training**
   - Trained a **Logistic Regression** model
   - Evaluated using accuracy score on validation set

## 📈 Result

- Achieved an **accuracy of 81%**
- Simple and explainable model
- Clean code and organized workflow
